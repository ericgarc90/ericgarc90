- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ericgarc90
I am interested in leveraging data to guide effective policy recommendations and spur market innovations to advance environmental ans social causes. 
Currently, I am working with Dr. Lawrence Goulder (Economics, Stanford) building a two-sector model that evaluates economic impacts of fuel standards and carbon taxes.
I am also working with Dr. Larry Goulder and other collaboraters at Tsinghua University on the economic impacts of China's new Emissions Trading Scheme.

My previous work mainly resides with optimization of utility-scale power systems, especially related to real-time wholesale electricity markets.

I am also involved in building a model that provides methane reduction recommendations to dairy producers.
